# Specifying an R environment by having a DESCRIPTION file

Jupyter+R: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-oilgains/binder-r-description/main?filepath=test-library.ipynb)

RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-oilgains/binder-r-description/main?urlpath=rstudio)


Goal is to build a Binder environment from an R package. The package is loaded with `library()` from within a Jupyter notebook.

Binder supports using R and RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific
snapshot on [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility).

If you specify a `runtime.txt` file that is formatted like:

```
r-<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>
```

where YYYY-MM-DD it will use the MRAN snapshot of that day for setting up the R runtime.

Without specifying a `runtime.txt` it will use a 2-day old snapshot of MRAN.

Both [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/)
are installed by default, so you can use either the Jupyter notebook interface or
the RStudio interface.
